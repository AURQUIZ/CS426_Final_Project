Project 3 - The Traveler
Alexis Urquiza (PM), Alfonso Arias, Larry Ngo

The design of this project uses 2 replicated "levels" to mimic the idea of time traveling.
When the player "uses" the time travel device, they're actually getting sent through a different
coordinate, which should be the same spot as the previous location. Different items are spawned
between the two levels and the player must collect one item and bring it back to the other timeline
in order to win the game.

We also used a few different types of monsters that will try to attack the player if they are within
the area of their zones. In order to defeat these monsters, the player must go through different timelines
to retrieve different items that are used to defeat the monsters. This type of design allows players to
defeat enemies in a different way then most games are used to having players defeat monsters,, while 
not being that complicated. The reasoning is that because the introduction of time traveling will be 
introduced to the player in the beginning, the learning process will be easy enough for the player to 
think of ways to work around the level and enemies. We want to introduce basic features to the player and 
then introduce features that the player should instinctively know how to utilize based off the things they've 
learned throughout the gameplay, also known as analogous learning.
